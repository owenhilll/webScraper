# webScraper
Standard web Scraper that utilizes Node.js (with axios and Cheerio modules) to pull specific data from https://stackoverflow.com/questions?tab=Bounties.  In my scrapper.js file, I pulled from a class s-link to fetch the question and a class labeled .s-post-summary--content .s-post-summary--content-title' to fetch the link to the question. to run the application, I titled my script 'scrap'. Therefore, npm run scrap executes the program.
