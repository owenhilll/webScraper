# webScraper
Standard web Scraper that utilizes Node.js (with axios.js and Cheerio.js modules) to pull specific data from https://stackoverflow.com/questions?tab=Bounties.  In my scrapper.js file, I used axios.js to fetch the HTML elements on the page. I located the desired elements I wish to use for the scrapper (bounty question and link). I then pulled from a class s-link to fetch the question from the axious response data and a class labeled .s-post-summary--content .s-post-summary--content-title' to fetch the link to the question. Both the question and the link were inserted as an object into an array. That array was then logged to the console. The prupose of this scrapper was to eleimante the non-essential information from the page, and provide quick and direct access to questions/links. to run the application, I titled my script 'scrap'. Therefore, npm run scrap executes the program.
